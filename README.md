# Fundamentals of CSS
## Transferring my notes of CSS in a web page format
### Gradually i will apply what i have learnt as the modules stack up

### Purpose

The reason behind this is so i can showcase my knowledge to any potential employers

### What

I am currently embarking on a Codecademy ** Full Stack Engineering Course ** I have completed HTML, CSS, JS sections 
and the github one, however i thought id start from the beginning and show case what i know so far. It also helps me
to recap on the content i covered.

As i complete each UNIT, I will create a website with all the skills i learnt. For example, with CSS nearly finishing, 
i will create a website where i utilize majority of the skills i learnt. Primarily, i will focus on what i struggled with 
the most and apply that.
