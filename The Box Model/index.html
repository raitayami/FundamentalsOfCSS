        <h1>The Box Model</h1>

        <h2>Introduction to the box model</h2>

        <p>An important concept to understand how elements are positioned and displayed on a website</p>
        <p>All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as living inside of a box</p>
        <h3>You will learn about:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The dimensions of an element's box. Width and height.</li>
            <li>Border</li>
            <li>Padding!</li>
            <li>Margin</li>
            <li>Overflow</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Box Model</h2>

        <p>The box model comprises the set of properties that defines parts of an element that takes up space on a web page</p>

        <img src="Images/BoxModel.png" alt="" class="conceptImg">

        <ul>
            <li>The width and height is for the content area</li>
            <li>Padding is the sapce between the content area and border</li>
            <li>Border is the thickness and styling of the space surrounding the content area and padding</li>
            <li>Margin is teh sapce between the border and the outside edge of the element</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Height and width</h2>

        <p>An element's content has two dimensions. Height and width.</p>
        <p>Pixels allow you to set the exact size of an element's box.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Border</h2>

        <p>Border is the line that surrounds an element. Borders can be set to a specific width, style, color</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Width. How thick is the border.</li>
            <li>Style. There are ltos of designs can be found on MDN.</li>
            <li>Color. The color of the border.</li>
            <li>All these values go in one line with space and propert of border: </li>
        </ul>

        <p>The default is "medium none color"</p>
        <p>If any of it is not defined, web browser assigns the default values</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Border Radius</h2>

        <p>You can modify the corners of an element's border box with the broder-radius property</p>

        <p>Doing border-radius: 5px -> will set all four courners of the border to a radius of 5 px</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Padding</h2>

        <p>The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as padding</p>
        <p>The padding property is often used to expand the background color and make the content look less cramped</p>

        <p>To be more speicfic about the amount of padding on each side of the box'x content, you can use these properties</p>
        <ul>
            <li>padding-top</li>
            <li>padding-bottom</li>
            <li>padding-right</li>
            <li>padding-left</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There is a shorthand you can use</p>
        <p>Padding shorthand lets you specify all of the padding proeprties as values on a single line</p>

        <ul>
            <li>4 values. Top right bottom left</li>
            <li>3 values. Top left and right bottom</li>
            <li>2 values. top and bottom. Left and right</li>
        </ul>


        <hr>

        <h2>Margin</h2>

        <p>Margin refers to the sapce directly outside of the box</p>
        <p>Same as padding, you can specify the side in which you want the margin to be applied on. </p>
        <p>The shorthand values apply too.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Auto</h2>

        <p>The margin property lets you center content</p>

        <p>margin: 0 auto; This code will center the divs in their containing elements</p>
        <p>The 0 sets the top and bottom margins to 0 pixels.</p>
        <p>The auto value instructs the browser to adjust the left and right margins until the element is centered within its containing element</p>
        <p>For this to work, the width has to be set for that element</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Margin collapse</h2>

        <p>Top and bottom margins collapse, while top and bottom padding does not</p>
        <p>Horizontal margins, like paddings, are always displayed and added together</p>
        <p>Vertical margins do not add. The larger figure out of the two vertical margins will be used</p>

        <img src="Images/MarginCollapse.png" alt="" class="conceptImg">

        <p>Notice how 30px is the distance between A and C and not 40px</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Minimum and maximum height and width</h2>

        <p>Content can suffer because a web page can be viewed through lots of different screen sizes</p>
        <p>CSS offers two proeprties that can limit how narrow or how wide an element's box can be</p>

        <ul>
            <li>min-width is a property to ensure a minimum width of an element's box</li>
            <li>max-width is a property to ensure a maximum width of an element's box</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Same concept with height</p>
        <p>When properties are set to low, content can spill outside, but there are ways to work around the issue</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Overflow</h2>

        <p>Sometimes componenets result in an element that is larger than the parent's area.</p>

        <p>The overflow property contorls what happens to content that spills outside its box</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hidden. Any content that overflow will be hiddem form view</li>
            <li>Scroll. A scroll bar is added to the element's box.</li>
            <li>Visible. This is the defaault value, the content will diplay outside the containing element</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The overflow property is set on a paremtn element to instruct a web browser on how to render child elements</strong></p>
        <p>If a div's overflow property is set to scroll, all of the children of the div will display overflowing content with a scroll bar</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Resetting defaults</h2>

        <p>All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they use in absence of an external stylesheet.</p>
        <p>They are known as user agent stylesheets. User agent is a technical term for browser.</p>
        <p>User agent stylesheets have default CSS rules that set default values for padding, margin</p>
        <p>Developers find this annoying so what they do is reset the default values. * { margin : 0, padding : 0 }</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Visibility</h2>

        <p>Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property</p>

        <p>The visibility porperty can be set to one of the following values:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hidden. Hides the element. This will leae an empty space where the element is inteded to display</li>
            <li>Visible. Displays the elem.</li>
            <li>Collapse. Collapse the element</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Visibility: hidden and display: none is different because using display to be none, removes that empty space completely</p>

        <h1>Changing the box model</h1>

        <h2>Why change the box model?</h2>

        <p>It needs changing because, the current box model that was taught, the border thickness, paddings are added to the overall dimensions of the box</p>

        <p>This results in difficulty to accurately size a box. Thus overtime, make it hard to position and manage contnet</p>

        <p>This lesson focuses on avoiding the problem, by learning new techniques</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Box model: Content box</h2>

        <p>In CSS, the box-sizing property controls the type of box model the browser should use when interpreting  a web page.</p>
        <p>The default value of this property is content-box. This value is the value that affects the dimensions of content (the problem we were talking about)</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>Box model: Border-Box</h2>

        <p>Border-box is the value that avoids the dimensional issues that exist in the former box model</p>

        <p>In this box model</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The height and width of the box remain fixed</li>
            <li>The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box</li>
            <li>The dimensions of the box do not change</li>
            <li>It is the content width that gets automatically sized</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To use this box model, use the unviersal selector and use the property box-sizing to change the value to border-box</p>

        <h2>Practice concepts</h2>
        <p>What is the value for the CSS property overflow that will add a scrollbar for the clipped content only when it is necessary</p>
        <p>Overflow: auto; The value auto for the property overflow will add a scrollbar only if the content has been clipped</p>
